    "You can use the [live version](https://ageller.github.io/Scatter_WebGL/) to drag-and-drop your own file and load your data into the viewer.  But if you want to run this locally (e.g., so that you can avoid the drag-and-drop feature and load your file by default), here are the steps you can follow. \n",

    "First, clone the GitHub repo: https://github.com/ageller/Scatter_WebGL\n",

    "```ID,time,x,y,z```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each particle gets it's own row during each time step (so you will have repeated values of time).  An example csv file is provided in the ```data``` directory.  You will need to copy your data to that ```data``` directory and name the file ```ScatterParts.csv```.  This will then become the default dataset that loads when you launch the viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is Python code that can spawn a server and show the viewer in a notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can start a server from your own terminal (without the need for this notebook) with :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python -m http.server```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can point your browser to the url ```http://localhost:8000```."
