This directory should contain your data file named ScatterParts.json, e.g.,
 
./binsingle --json 1 -D 0.01 > ScatterParts.json

Alternatively, you can create data in Python and write it as a .json with the correct here.  See the notebook in the root directory for details. I included a .csv file of other scattering data here to test.
