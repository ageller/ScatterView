This directory should contain your data file named ScatterParts.csv.  The .csv format must have columns of :

```ID,time,x,y,z```

(The first row of the file must have those columns labeled.  Other columns are OK to include but will be ignored.)  Each particle gets it's own row during each time step (so you will have repeated values of time).  An example csv file is provided in this directory.
